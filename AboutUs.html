Everyone loved her recipe so much that she decided to open a small Chocolate shop, but she eventually gave up her dream of owning her own business in order to raise her two small children. 
She moved her baking equipment to a kitchen in her basement and continued to supply chocolates to several of the best shops in town while raising her family.
<br/>
 With great foresight and intuition, their son decided to open a chocolate shop to showcase his mother’s selection of chocolates. Somehow he just knew that children would enjoy chocolates with an extensive menu.  The shop was an immediate success and today there are nearly 200 Bertha’s Deluxe Chocolates Shops around the world that share 
 the Overton’s commitment to quality and spirit of innovation and hard work.
